# Code

### Assembling variants and annotations for analysis
We have made available the scripts used to assembled variants and annotations in /Assemble_data/Assemble_dataframes.R
Please see the data folder to find out how to obtain the variants data from PCAWGs publicly accessible samples.

### Generating predictive models
The code we used to generate predictive models of DDR deficiencies may be found in /Generating_models, with separate scripts for model generation in a discovery/validation setting and in a full-dataset setting.
